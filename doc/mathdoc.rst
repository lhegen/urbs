Introduction
============
In this Section, **mathematical description** of the model will be explained. This includes listing and describing all relevant sets, parameters, variables
and constraints using mathematical notation together with corresponding code fragment. 

Sets
====

Since urbs is a linear optimization model with many objects (e.g variables, parameters), it is reasonable to use
sets to define the groups of objects. With the usage of sets, many facilities are provided, such as
understanding the main concepts of the model. Many objects are represented by various sets,
therefore sets can be easily used to check whether some object has a specific characteristic or not.
Additionally sets are useful to define a hierarchy of objects. 
Mathematical notation of sets are expressed with uppercase letters, and their members are usually expressed with the same
lowercase letters. Main sets, tuple sets and subsets will be introduced in this respective order.

Time Steps
^^^^^^^^^^

The model urbs is considered to observe a energy system model and calculate the optimal solution within a limited span of time.
This limited span of time is viewed as a discrete variable, which means values of variables are viewed as occurring only at distinct timesteps.
The set of **time steps** :math:`T = \{t_0,\dots,t_N\}` for :math:`N` in :math:`\mathbb{N}`
represents Time. This set contains :math:`N+1` sequential time steps with equal spaces.
Each time step represents another point in time. At the initialisation of the model this set
is fixed by the user by setting the variable ``timesteps`` in script ``runme.py``.
Duration of space between timesteps :math:`\Delta t = t_{x+1} - t_x`, length of simulation :math:`\Delta t \cdot N` and
time interval :math:`[t_0,t_N]` can be fixed to satisfy the needs of the user.
In code this set is defined by the set ``t`` and initialized by the section:

::

    m.t = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.timesteps,
        ordered=True,
        doc='Set of timesteps')
		
Where:

* `Initialize`: A function that receives the set indices and model to return the value of that set element, initializes the set with data.
* `Ordered`: A boolean value that indicates whether the set is ordered.
* `Doc`: A string describing the set.

Modelled Timesteps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Set, **modelled timesteps**, is a subset of the time steps set. The difference between modelled
timesteps set and the timesteps set is that the initial timestep :math:`t_0` is not included.
All other features of the set time steps also apply to the set of modelled timesteps. This set
is later required to facilitate the definition of the storage state equation.
In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined by the set ``tm`` and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.tm = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.t,
        initialize=m.timesteps[1:],
        ordered=True,
        doc='Set of modelled timesteps')
		
Where:

* `Within`: The option that supports the validation of a set array.
* ``m.timesteps[1:]`` represents the timesteps set starting from the second element, excluding the first timestep :math:`t_0`

Sites
^^^^^

**Sites** are represented by the set :math:`V`. A Site :math:`v` can be any distinct location, a place of
settlement or activity (e.g `process`, `transmission`, `storage`).A site is for example an individual
building, region, country or even continent. Sites can be imagined as nodes(vertices) on a graph of locations,
connected by edges. Index of this set are the descriptions of the Sites (e.g north, middle, south).
In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined by ``sit`` and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.sit = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.commodity.index.get_level_values('Site').unique(),
        doc='Set of sites')
		
Commodities
^^^^^^^^^^^

As explained in the Overview section, **commodities** are goods that can be
generated, stored, transmitted or consumed. The set of Commodities represents all goods that
are relevant to the modelled energy system, such as all energy carriers, inputs, outputs,
intermediate substances. (e.g Coal, CO2, Electric, Wind) By default, commodities are given by their
energy content (MWh). Usage of some commodities are limited by a maximum value or maximum value
per timestep due to their availability or restrictions, also some commodities have a price that
needs to be compensated..(e.g coal, wind, solar).In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined by ``com`` 
and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.com = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.commodity.index.get_level_values('Commodity').unique(),
        doc='Set of commodities')
		
Commodity Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Commodities differ in their usage purposes, consequently **commodity types** are introduced to subdivide commodities by their features.
These Types are ``SupIm``, ``Stock``, ``Demand``, ``Env``, ``Buy``, ``Sell``. In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined as ``com_type`` 
and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.com_type = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.commodity.index.get_level_values('Type').unique(),
        doc='Set of commodity types')
		

Processes
^^^^^^^^^

One of the most important elements of an energy system is the **process**. A process :math:`p` can be defined by
the action of changing one or more forms of energy to others. In our modelled energy system,
processes convert input commodities into output commodities. Process technologies are represented by
the set processes :math:`P`. Different processes technologies have fixed input and output commodities. These input and output commodities
can be either single or multiple regardless of each other. Some example members of this set can be:
`Wind Turbine`,`Gas Plant`, `Photovoltaics`.
In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined as ``pro`` and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.pro = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.process.index.get_level_values('Process').unique(),
        doc='Set of conversion processes')
		
Storages
^^^^^^^^

Energy **Storage** is provided by technical facilities that store energy to generate a commodity at
a later time for the purpose of meeting the demand. Occasionally, on-hand commodities
may not be able to satisfy the required amount of energy to meet the demand, or the available
amount of energy may be much more than required.Storage technologies play a major role in such circumstances.
The Set :math:`S` represents all storage technologies.(e.g `Pump storage`).
In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined as ``sto`` and initalized by the code fragment:

::

    m.sto = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.storage.index.get_level_values('Storage').unique(),
        doc='Set of storage technologies')
		
Transmissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Transmissions** :math:`f \in F` represent possible conveyances of commodities between sites.
Transmission process technologies can vary between different commodities,
due to distinct physical attributes and forms of commodities. Some examples for Transmission technologies are: `hvac`, `hvdc`, `pipeline`)
In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined as ``tra`` and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.tra = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=m.transmission.index.get_level_values('Transmission').unique(),
        doc='Set of transmission technologies')
		
Cost Types
^^^^^^^^^^

One of the major goals of the model is to calculate the costs of a simulated energy system.
There are 6 different types of costs. Each one has different features and are defined for
different instances. Set of **cost types** is hardcoded, which means they are not considered to be
fixed or changed  by the user.
The Set :math:`R` defines the Cost Types, each member :math:`r` of this set :math:`R` represents a unique cost type name.
The cost types are : ``Investment``, ``Fix``, ``Variable``, ``Fuel``, ``Revenue``, ``Purchase``.
In script ``urbs.py`` this set is defined as ``cost_type`` and initialized by the code fragment:

::

    m.cost_type = pyomo.Set(
        initialize=['Inv', 'Fix', 'Var', 'Fuel','Revenue','Purchase'],
        doc='Set of cost types (hard-coded)')
		

Tuple Sets
==========

A tuple is finite, ordered collection of elements.For example, the tuple ``(hat,red,large)`` consists of 3 ordered elements 
and defines another element itself.
Tuples are needed in this model to define the combinations of elements from different sets.
Defining a tuple lets us assemble related elements and use them as a single element.
As a result a collection of by the same rule defined tuples, represents a tuple set.

Commodity Tuples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commodity tuples represent combinations of defined commodities.
These are represented by the set :math:`C_{vq}`.
A member :math:`c_{vq}` in set :math:`C_{vq}` is a commodity :math:`c` of commodity type :math:`q` in site :math:`v`.
For example, `(Mid, Elec, Demand)` is interpreted as commodity `Elec` of commodity type `Demand` in site `Mid`.
This set is defined as ``com_tuples`` and given by the code fragment:

::

    m.com_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.com*m.com_type,
        initialize=m.commodity.index,
        doc='Combinations of defined commodities, e.g. (Mid,Elec,Demand)')
		

Process Tuples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Process tuples represent combinations of possible processes.
These are represented by the set :math:`P_v`.
A member :math:`p_v` in set :math:`P_v` is a process :math:`p` in site :math:`v`.
For example, `(North, Coal Plant)` is interpreted as process `Coal Plant` in site `North`.
This set is defined as ``pro_tuples`` and given by the code fragment:

::

    m.pro_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.pro,
        initialize=m.process.index,
        doc='Combinations of possible processes, e.g. (North,Coal plant)')
		

Transmission Tuples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transmission tuples represent combinations of possible transmissions.
These are represented by the set :math:`F_{c{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}}`.
A member :math:`f_{c{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}}` in set :math:`F_{c{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}}` is a transmission :math:`f`,that is directed from an origin site :math:`v_\text{out}` to a destination site :math:`v_{in}` and carries a commodity :math:`c`.
The term "\ `directed from an origin site` :math:`v_\text{out}` `to a destination site` :math:`v_\text{in}`" can also be defined as an Arc :math:`a` .
For example, `(South, Mid, hvac, Elec)` is interpreted as transmission `hvac` that is directed from origin site `South` to destination site `Mid` carrying commodity `Elec`.
This set is defined as ``tra_tuples`` and given by the code fragment:

::

    m.tra_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.sit*m.tra*m.com,
        initialize=m.transmission.index,
        doc='Combinations of possible transmission, e.g. (South,Mid,hvac,Elec)')
		

Additionally, Subsets :math:`F_{vc}^\text{exp}` and :math:`F_{vc}^\text{imp}` represents all exporting and importing transmissions of a commodity :math:`c` in a site :math:`v`.
These subsets can be obtained by fixing either the origin site(for export) :math:`v_\text{out}` or the destination site(for import) :math:`v_\text{in}` to a desired site :math:`v` in tuple set :math:`F_{c{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}}`.

Storage Tuples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Storage tuples represent combinations of possible storages by site.
These are represented by the set :math:`S_{vc}`.
A member :math:`s_{vc}` in set :math:`S_{vc}` is a storage :math:`s` of commodity :math:`c` in site :math:`v`
For example, `(Mid, Bat, Elec)` is interpreted as storage `Bat` of commodity `Elec` in site `Mid`.
This set is defined as ``sto_tuples`` and given by the code fragment:

::

    m.sto_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.sto*m.com,
        initialize=m.storage.index,
        doc='Combinations of possible storage by site, e.g. (Mid,Bat,Elec)')
		

Process Input Tuples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Process input tuples represent commodities consumed by processes.
These are represented by the set :math:`C_{vp}^\text{in}`.
A member :math:`c_{vp}^\text{in}` in set :math:`C_{vp}^\text{in}` is a commodity :math:`c` consumed by the process :math:`p` in site :math:`v`.
For example, `(Mid,PV,Solar)` is interpreted as commodity `Solar` is consumed by the process `PV` in the site `Mid`. 
This set is defined as ``pro_input_tuples`` and given by the code fragment:

::

    m.pro_input_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.pro*m.com,
        initialize=[(site, process, commodity)
                    for (site, process) in m.pro_tuples
                    for (pro, commodity) in m.r_in.index
                    if process == pro],
        doc='Commodities consumed by process by site, e.g. (Mid,PV,Solar)')

Where: ``r_in`` represents the process input ratio.

Process Output Tuples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Process output tuples represent commodities generated by processes.
These are represented by the set :math:`C_{vp}^\text{out}`.
A member :math:`c_{vp}^\text{out}` in set :math:`C_{vp}^\text{out}` is a commodity :math:`c` generated by the process :math:`p` in site :math:`v`.
For example, `(Mid,PV,Elec)` is interpreted as the commodity `Elec` is generated by the process `PV` in the site `Mid`. 
This set is defined as ``pro_output_tuples`` and given by the code fragment:

::

    m.pro_output_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.pro*m.com,
        initialize=[(site, process, commodity)
                    for (site, process) in m.pro_tuples
                    for (pro, commodity) in m.r_out.index
                    if process == pro],
        doc='Commodities produced by process by site, e.g. (Mid,PV,Elec)')
		
Where: ``r_out`` represents the process output ratio.

Commodity Type Subsets
======================

Commodity Type Subsets represent the commodity tuples only from a given commodity type.
Commodity Type Subsets are subsets of the sets commodity tuples
These subsets can be obtained by fixing the commodity type :math:`q` to a desired commodity type (e.g SupIm, Stock) in the set commodity tuples :math:`C_{vq}`.
Since there are 6 types of commodity types, there are also 6 commodity type subsets. Commodity type subsets are;

	**Supply Intermittent Commodities** (``SupIm``): The set :math:`C_\text{sup}` represents all commodities :math:`c` of commodity type ``SupIm``. Commodities of this type have intermittent timeseries, in other words, availability of these commodities are not constant. These commodities might have various energy content for every timestep :math:`t`. For example solar radiation is contingent on many factors such as sun position, weather and varies permanently.

	**Stock Commodities** (``Stock``): The set :math:`C_\text{st}` represents all commodities :math:`c` of commodity type ``Stock``. Commodities of this type can be purchased at any time for a given price( :math:`k_{vc}^\text{fuel}`).

	**Sell Commodities** (``Sell``): The set :math:`C_\text{sell}` represents all commodities :math:`c` of commodity type ``Sell``. Commodities that can be sold. These Commodities have a sell price ( :math:`k_{vct}^\text{bs}` ) that may vary with the given timestep :math:`t`.

	**Buy Commodities** (``Buy``): The set :math:`C_\text{buy}` represents all commodities :math:`c` of commodity type ``Buy``. Commodities that can be purchased. These Commodities have a buy price ( :math:`k_{vc}^\text{bs}` ) that may vary with the given timestep :math:`t`.

	**Demand Commodities** (``Demand``): The set :math:`C_\text{dem}` represents all commodities :math:`c` of commodity type ``Demand``. Commodities of this type are the requested commodities of the energy system. They are usually the end product of the model (e.g Electricity:Elec).

	**Environmental Commodities** (``Env``): The set :math:`C_\text{env}` represents all commodities :math:`c` of commodity type ``Env``. Commodities of this type are usually the undesired byproducts of processes that might be harmful for environment, optional maximum creation limits can be set to control the generation of these commodities (e.g Greenhouse Gas Emissions: :math:`\text{CO}_2`).

Commodity Type Subsets are given by the code fragment:
::

    m.com_supim = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.com,
        initialize=commodity_subset(m.com_tuples, 'SupIm'),
        doc='Commodities that have intermittent (timeseries) input')
    m.com_stock = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.com,
        initialize=commodity_subset(m.com_tuples, 'Stock'),
        doc='Commodities that can be purchased at some site(s)')
    m.com_sell = pyomo.Set(
       within=m.com,
       initialize=commodity_subset(m.com_tuples, 'Sell'),
       doc='Commodities that can be sold')
    m.com_buy = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.com,
        initialize=commodity_subset(m.com_tuples, 'Buy'),
        doc='Commodities that can be purchased')
    m.com_demand = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.com,
        initialize=commodity_subset(m.com_tuples, 'Demand'),
        doc='Commodities that have a demand (implies timeseries)')
    m.com_env = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.com,
        initialize=commodity_subset(m.com_tuples, 'Env'),
        doc='Commodities that (might) have a maximum creation limit')

Where:

.. function:: commodity_subset(com_tuples, type_name)

  Returns the commodity names(:math:`c`) of the given commodity type(:math:`q`).

  :param com_tuples: A list of tuples (site, commodity, commodity type)
  :param type_name: A commodity type or a list of commodity types

  :return: The set (unique elements/list) of commodity names of the desired commodity type.
  
Transmission Subset
======================

Transmission subset represents the transmission tuples for which dc_flow_rule is valid. This is when transmission technology is set to `hvac` and admittance is in the range of real numbers. 
Transmission subset is a subset of transmission tuples. 
This subset can be obtained by filtering the transmission tuples :math:`F_{c{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}}` by transmission technology. Additionaly the values of addmitance have to be tested to fullfill the above mentioned constraints.

Transmission Subset is given by the code fragment:
::

m.dc_flow_tuples = pyomo.Set(
        within=m.sit*m.sit*m.tra*m.com,
        initialize=dc_flow_subset(m, m.tra_tuples, 'hvac'),
        doc='Transmission lines for hvac (dc flow rule is valid)')
        
Where:

.. function:: dc_flow_subset(m, tra_tuples, type_name)

    """unique list of transmission tuples for given type with given admittance.
    
    Args: 
        m: the created model, to access admittance parameter
        tra_tuples: a list of (site in, site out, transmission type, commodity) tuples
        type_name: a transmission type
        
    Returns: 
        The set of transmission tuples of desired type
        for which dc_flow_rule is valid and admittance is given
    """
    return set((site_in, site_out, transmission, commodity) 
                for site_in, site_out, transmission, commodity in tra_tuples
                if transmission == type_name
                and not math.isnan(m.transmission.loc[site_in,site_out,transmission,commodity]['admittance']) )


Variables
=========
All the variables that the optimization model requires to calculate an optimal
solution will be listed and defined in this section.
A variable is a numerical value that is determined during optimization.
Variables can denote a single, independent value, or an array of
values. Variables define the search space for optimization.
Variables of this optimization model can be seperated into sections by their area of use.
These Sections are Cost, Commodity, Process, Transmission and Storage.

Cost Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Total System Cost**, :math:`\zeta` : the variable :math:`\zeta` represents
the *annual total expense incurred* in reaching the satisfaction of the given energy demand.
This is calculated by the sum total of all costs by type(:math:`\zeta_r`, :math:`\forall r \in R`) and defined as  ``costs`` by the following code fragment:

::

    m.costs = pyomo.Var(
        m.cost_type,

        doc='Costs by type (EUR/a)')

More information on calculation of this variable is available at the `Cost Function`_ section.

Total System costs by type: System costs are divided into 6 cost types by their meaning and purpose.
The separation of costs by type, facilitates business planning and provides calculation accuracy
As mentioned before these cost types are hardcoded, which means they are not considered to be fixed or changed by the user.
These cost types are as following;

	**Investment Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` represents the annualised total investment costs.
		Costs for required new investments on storage, process and transmission technologies.
	
	**Fix Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` represents the annualised total fix costs.
		Fix costs for all used storage, process, and transmission technologies. Such as maintenance costs.
		
	**Variable Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{var}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{var}` represents the annualised total variables costs.
		Variable costs that are reliant on the usage amount and period of the storage, process, transmission technologies.
		
	**Fuel Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{fuel}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{fuel}` represents the annualised total fuel costs.
		Fuel costs are dependent on the usage of stock commodities( :math:`\forall c \in C_\text{stock}`).
		
	**Revenue Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{rev}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{rev}` represents the annualised total revenue costs.
		Revenue costs is defined for the costs that occures by selling the sell commodities( :math:`\forall c \in C_\text{sell}`).
		Since this variable is an income for the system, it is either zero or has a negative value.
		
	**Purchase Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{pur}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{pur}` represents the annualised total purchase costs.
		Purchase costs is defined for the costs that occures by buying the buy commodities ( :math:`\forall c \in C_\text{buy}` ).

**Annuity factor**, :math:`AF(n,i)`,: Annuity factor :math:`AF` is used to calculate the present value of future fixed annuities. The parameter annuity factor is the only parameter that is not given as an input by the user. This parameter is derived from the parameters WACC :math:`i` (Weighted average cost of capital) and Depreciation :math:`z` by the annuity factor formula. The value of this parameter is expressed with the following equation.
 
.. math::

	AF = \frac{(1+i)^n i}{(1+i)^n - 1}

where;

* n represents the depreciation period :math:`z`.
* i represents the weighted average cost of capital(wacc) :math:`i`.

This derived parameter is calculated by the helper function :func:`annuity factor` and defined by the following code fragment. ::

    # derive annuity factor from WACC and depreciation periods
    process['annuity-factor'] = annuity_factor(
        process['depreciation'], process['wacc'])
    transmission['annuity-factor'] = annuity_factor(
        transmission['depreciation'], transmission['wacc'])
    storage['annuity-factor'] = annuity_factor(
        storage['depreciation'], storage['wacc'])

.. function:: annuity_factor

  Annuity factor formula.

  Evaluates the annuity factor formula for depreciation duration
  and interest rate. Works also well for equally sized numpy arrays as input.
    
  :param int n: number of depreciation periods (years)
  :param float i: interest rate (e.g. 0.06 means 6 %)

  :return: value of the expression :math:`\frac{(1+i)^n i}{(1+i)^n - 1}`

-------------------------------

The unit of this parameter is €/MWh. The related section for this parameter in the spreadsheet can be found under the "Commodity" sheet. Here each row represents another commodity tuple :math:`c_{vq}` and the fourth column of stock commodity tuples (:math:`\forall q = "Stock"`) in this sheet with the header label "price" represents the corresponding parameter :math:`k_{vc}^\text{fuel}`.

**Buy/Sell Commodity Buy/Sell Costs**, :math:`k_{vct}^\text{bs}`, ``com_prices[c].loc[tm]``: The parameter :math:`k_{vct}^\text{bs}` represents the purchase/buy cost for purchasing/selling one unit(1 MWh) of a buy/sell commodity :math:`c` (:math:`\forall c \in C_\text{buy}`)/(:math:`\forall c \in C_\text{sell}`) in a site :math:`v` (:math:`\forall v \in V`) at a timestep :math:`t` (:math:`\forall t \in T_m`). The unit of this parameter is €/MWh. The related section for this parameter in the spreadsheet can be found under the "Commodity" sheet. Here each row represents another commodity tuple :math:`c_{vq}` and the fourth column of buy/sell commodity tuples (:math:`\forall q = "Buy"`)/(:math:`\forall q = "Sell"`) in this sheet with the header label "price" represents how the parameter :math:`k_{vct}^\text{bs}` will be defined. There are two options for this parameter. This parameter will either be a fix value for the whole simulation duration or will vary with the timesteps :math:`t`. For the first option, if the buy/sell price of a buy/sell commodity is a fix value for the whole simulation duration, this value can be entered directly into the corresponding cell with the unit €/MWh. For the second option, if the buy/sell price of a buy/sell commodity depends on time, accordingly on timesteps, a string (a linear sequence of characters, words, or other data) should be written in the corresponding cell. An example string looks like this: "1,25xBuy" where the first numbers (1,25) represent a coefficient for the price. This value is than multiplied by values from another list given with timeseries. Here the word "Buy" refers to a timeseries located in ""Buy-Sell-Price"" sheet with commodity names, types and timesteps. This timeseries should be filled with time dependent buy/sell price variables. The parameter :math:`k_{vct}^\text{bs}` is then calculated by the product of the price coefficient and the related time variable for a given timestep :math:`t`. This calculation and the decision for one of the two options is executed by the helper function :func:`get_com_price`.

.. function:: get_com_price(instance, tuples)

  :param str instance: a Pyomo ConcreteModel instance
  :param list tuples: a list of (site, commodity, commodity type) tuples
  
  :return: a Pandas DataFrame with entities as columns and timesteps as index
  
  Calculate commodity prices for each modelled timestep.
  Checks whether the input is a float. If it is a float it gets the input value as a fix value for commodity price. Otherwise if the input value is not a float, but a string, it extracts the price coefficient from the string and  multiplies it with a timeseries of commodity price variables.

Equations
=========

Cost Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variable total system cost :math:`\zeta` is calculated by the cost function. The cost function is the objective function of the optimization  model. Minimizing the value of the variable total system cost would give the most reasonable solution for the modelled energy system  The formula of the cost function expressed in mathematical notation is as following:

.. math::

	\zeta = \zeta_\text{inv} + \zeta_\text{fix} + \zeta_\text{var} + \zeta_\text{fuel} + \zeta_\text{rev} + \zeta_\text{pur}

The calculation of the variable total system cost is given in ``urbs.py`` by the following code fragment.  

::

	def obj_rule(m):
		return pyomo.summation(m.costs)

The variable total system cost :math:`\zeta` is basically calculated by the summation of every type of total costs. As previously mentioned on `Cost Types`_ these cost types are : ``Investment``, ``Fix``, ``Variable``, ``Fuel``, ``Revenue``, ``Purchase``. The calculation of each single cost types are listed below.

Investment Costs
----------------

The variable investment costs :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` represent the required annual expenses made, in the hope of future benefits. These expenses are made on every new investment. The possible investments of an energy system in this model are:

1. Additional power output capacity for process technologies.
2. Additional power output capacity for storage technologies and additional content capacity for storage technologies.
3. Additional power output capacity for transmission technologies.

The calculation of total annual investment cost :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` is expressed by the formula: 

.. math::

	\zeta_\text{inv} = 
	\sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ p \in P}} \hat{\kappa}_{vp} k_p^\text{inv} +
	\sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ s \in S}} \left( \hat{\kappa}_{vs}^\text{c} k_{vs}^\text{c,inv} + \hat{\kappa}_{vs}^\text{p} k_{vs}^\text{p,inv}\right) +
	\sum_{\substack{a \in A\\ f \in F}} \hat{\kappa}_{af} k_{af}^\text{inv}


Total annual investment cost is calculated by the sum of three main summands, these are the investment costs for processes, storages, and transmissions. 

1. The first summand of the formula calculates the required annual investment expenses to install an additional power output capacity to process technologies for every member of the set process tuples :math:`\forall p_v \in P_v`. Total process investment cost for all process tuples is defined by the sum of all possible annual process investment costs, which are calculated seperately for each process tuple ( :math:`p_v`, ``m.pro_tuples``) consisting of process :math:`p` in site :math:`v`. Annual process investment cost for a given process tuple :math:`p_v` is calculated by the product of the variable new process capacity ( :math:`\hat{\kappa}_{vp}`,``m.cap_pro_new``) and the parameter annualised process capacity investment cost ( :math:`k_{vp}^\text{inv}`, ``m.process.loc[p]['inv-cost'] * m.process.loc[p]['annuity-factor']``). In mathematical notation this summand is expressed as:

.. math:: \sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ p \in P}} \hat{\kappa}_{vp} k_p^\text{inv}

2. The second summand of the formula calculates the required investment expenses to install additional power output capacity and storage content capacity to storage technologies for every member of the set storage tuples ( :math:`\forall s_{vc} \in S_{vc}`). This summand consists of two products:
	* The first product calculates the required annual investment expenses to install an additional storage content capacity to a given storage tuple . This is calculated by the product of the variable new storage size ( :math:`\hat{\kappa}_{vs}^\text{c}`, ``cap_sto_c_new``) and the parameter annualised storage size investment costs ( :math:`k_{vs}^\text{c,inv}`, ``m.storage.loc[s]['inv-cost-c'] * m.storage.loc[s]['annuity-factor']``).
	* The second product calculates the required annual investment expenses to install an additional power output capacity to a given storage tuple. This is calculated by the product of the variable new storage power ( :math:`\hat{\kappa}_{vs}^\text{p}`, ``cap_sto_p_new``) and the parameter annualised storage power investment costs ( :math:`k_{vs}^\text{p,inv}`, ``m.storage.loc[s]['inv-cost-p'] * m.storage.loc[s]['annuity-factor']``).

   These two products for a given storage tuple are than added up. The calculation of investment costs for a given storage tuple is than repeated for every single storage tuple and summed up to calculate the total investment costs for storage technologies. In mathematical notation this summand is expressed as:

.. math:: \sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ s \in S}} ( \hat{\kappa}_{vs}^\text{c} k_{vs}^\text{c,inv} + \hat{\kappa}_{vs}^\text{p} k_{vs}^\text{p,inv})

3. The third and the last summand of the formula calculates the required investment expenses to install additional power output capacity to transmission technologies for every member of the set transmission tuples :math:`\forall f_{ca} \in F_{ca}`. Total transmission investment cost for all transmission tuples is defined by the sum of all possible annual transmission investment costs, which are calculated seperately for each transmission tuple ( :math:`f_{ca}`). Annual transmission investment cost for a given transmission tuple is calculated by the product of the variable new transmission capacity ( :math:`\hat{\kappa}_{af}`, ``cap_tra_new``) and the parameter annualised transmission capacity investment costs ( :math:`k_{af}^\text{inv}`, ``m.transmission.loc[t]['inv-cost'] * m.transmission.loc[t]['annuity-factor']``) for the given transmission tuple. In mathematical notation this summand is expressed as:

.. math:: \sum_{\substack{a \in A\\ f \in F}} \hat{\kappa}_{af} k_{af}^\text{inv}

As mentioned above the variable investment costs :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` is calculated by the sum of these 3 summands.

In script ``urbs.py`` the value of the total investment cost is calculated by the following code fragment:

::

    if cost_type == 'Inv':
        return m.costs['Inv'] == \
            sum(m.cap_pro_new[p] *
                m.process.loc[p]['inv-cost'] *
                m.process.loc[p]['annuity-factor']
                for p in m.pro_tuples) + \
            sum(m.cap_tra_new[t] *
                m.transmission.loc[t]['inv-cost'] *
                m.transmission.loc[t]['annuity-factor']
                for t in m.tra_tuples) + \
            sum(m.cap_sto_p_new[s] *
                m.storage.loc[s]['inv-cost-p'] *
                m.storage.loc[s]['annuity-factor'] +
                m.cap_sto_c_new[s] *
                m.storage.loc[s]['inv-cost-c'] *
                m.storage.loc[s]['annuity-factor']
                for s in m.sto_tuples)

Fix Costs
---------

The variable fix costs :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` represents the total annual fixed costs for all used storage, process and transmission technologies. The possible fix costs of an energy system in this model can be divided into sections, these are:

1. Fix costs for process technologies
2. Fix costs for storage technologies
3. Fix costs for transmission technologies.

The calculation of total annual fix cost :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` is expressed by the formula:

.. math::

	\zeta_\text{fix} = 
	\sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ p \in P}} \kappa_{vp} k_{vp}^\text{fix} +
	\sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ s \in S}} \left( \kappa_{vs}^\text{c} k_{vs}^\text{c,fix} + \kappa_{vs}^\text{p} k_{vs}^\text{p,fix} \right) +
	\sum_{\substack{a \in A\\ f \in F}} \kappa_{af} k_{af}^\text{fix}

Total annual fix cost :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` is calculated by the sum of three main summands, these are the fix costs for process, storage and transmission technologies.

1. The first summand of the formula calculates the required annual fix cost to keep all the process technologies maintained. This is calculated for every member of the set process tuples :math:`\forall p_v \in P_v`. Total process fix cost for all process tuples is defined by the sum of all possible annual process fix costs, which are calculated seperately for each process tuple ( :math:`p_v`, ``m.pro_tuples``) consisting of process :math:`p` in site :math:`v`. Annual process fix cost for a given process tuple is calculated by the product of the variable total process capacity ( :math:`\kappa_{vp}`, ``cap_pro``) and process capacity fixed cost ( :math:`k_{vp}^\text{fix}`, ``m.process.loc[p]['fix-cost']``). In mathematical notation this summand is expressed as:

.. math:: \sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ p \in P}} \kappa_{vp} k_{vp}^\text{fix}

2. The second summand of the formula calculates the required fix expenses to keep the power output capacity and storage content capacity of storage technologies maintained. The storage technologies here are, every member of the set storage tuples :math:`\forall s_{vc} \in S_{vc}`. This summand consists of two products:
	* The first product calculates the required annual fix expenses to keep the storage content capacity of a given storage tuple maintained.  This is calculated by the product of the variable total storage size ( :math:`\kappa_{vs}^\text{c}`, ``cap_sto_c``) and the parameter annual storage size fixed costs ( :math:`k_{vs}^\text{c,fix}`, ``m.storage.loc[s]['fix-cost-c']``).
	* The second product calculates the required annual fix expenses to keep the power output capacity of a given storage tuple maintained. This is calculated by the product of the variable total storage power ( :math:`\kappa_{vs}^\text{p}`, ``cap_sto_p``) and the parameter annual storage power fixed costs (:math:`k_{vs}^\text{p,fix}`, ``m.storage.loc[s]['fix-cost-p']``).

   These two products for a given storage tuple are than added up. The calculation of fix costs for a storage tuple is then repeated for every single storage tuple and summed up to calculate the total fix costs for storage technologies. In mathematical notation this summand is expressed as:

.. math:: \sum_{\substack{v \in V\\ s \in S}} (\kappa_{vs}^\text{c} k_{vs}^\text{c,fix} + \kappa_{vs}^\text{p} k_{vs}^\text{p,fix})

3. The third and the last summand of the formula calculates the required fix expenses to keep the power output capacity of transmission technologies maintained. The transmission technologies here are, every member of the set transmission tuples :math:`\forall f_{ca} \in F_{ca}`. Total transmission fix cost for all transmission tuples is defined by the sum of all possible annual transmission fix costs, which are calculated seperately for each transmission tuple :math:`f_{ca}`. Annual transmission fix cost for a given transmission tuple is calculated by the product of the variable total transmission capacity ( :math:`\kappa_{af}`, ``cap_tra``) and the parameter annual transmission capacity fixed costs ( :math:`k_{af}^\text{fix}`, ``m.transmission.loc[t]['fix-cost']``) for the given transmission tuple :math:`f_{ca}`. In mathematical notation this summand is expressed as:

.. math:: \sum_{\substack{a \in A\\ f \in F}} \kappa_{af} k_{af}^\text{fix}

As mentioned above the variable fix costs :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` is calculated by the sum of these 3 summands.

In script ``urbs.py`` the value of the total fix cost is calculated by the following code fragment:

Commodity Balance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function commodity balance calculates the balance of a commodity :math:`c` in a site :math:`v` at a timestep :math:`t`. Commodity balance function facilitates the formulation of commodity constraints. The formula for commodity balance is expressed in mathematical notation as:

.. math::

	\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) = 
          \sum_{{p|c \in C_{vp}^\text{in}}} \epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{in}
        - \sum_{{p|c \in C_{vp}^\text{out}}} \epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{out}
        + \sum_{{s\in S_{vc}}} \left( \epsilon_{vst}^\text{in} - \epsilon_{vst}^\text{out} \right)
        + \sum_{{\substack{a\in A_v^\text{s}\\ f \in F_{vc}^\text{exp}}}} \pi_{aft}^\text{in}
        - \sum_{{\substack{a\in A_v^\text{p}\\ f \in F_{vc}^\text{imp}}}} \pi_{aft}^\text{out}

This function sums up for a given commodity :math:`c`, site :math:`v` and timestep :math:`t`;

	* the consumption: Process input commodity flow  :math:`\epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{in}` of all process tuples using the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
	* the export: Input transmission power flow :math:`\pi_{aft}^\text{in}` of all transmission tuples exporting the commodity :math:`c` from the origin site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
	* the storage input: Input power flow :math:`\epsilon_{vst}^\text{in}` of all storage tuples storing the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.

and subtracts for the same given commodity :math:`c`, site :math:`v` and timestep :math:`t`;
	* the creation: Process output commodity flow :math:`\epsilon_{vcpt}^\text{out}` of all process tuples using the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
	* the import: Output transmission power flow :math:`\pi_{aft}^\text{out}` of all transmission tuples importing the commodity math:`c` to the destination site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.
	* the storage output: Output power flow :math:`\epsilon_{vst}^\text{out}` of all storage tuples storing the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t`.

The value of the function :math:`\mathrm{CB}` being greater than zero :math:`\mathrm{CB} > 0` means that the presence of the commodity :math:`c` in the site :math:`v` at the timestep :math:`t` is getting less than before by the technologies given above. Correspondingly, the value of the function being greater than zero means that the presence of the commodity in the site at the timestep is getting more than before by the technologies given above.

In script ``urbs.py`` the value of the commodity balance function :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` is calculated by the following code fragment: 

::

	def commodity_balance(m, tm, sit, com):
		balance = 0
		for site, process in m.pro_tuples:
			if site == sit and com in m.r_in.loc[process].index:
				# usage as input for process increases balance
				balance += m.e_pro_in[(tm, site, process, com)]
			if site == sit and com in m.r_out.loc[process].index:
				# output from processes decreases balance
				balance -= m.e_pro_out[(tm, site, process, com)]
		for site_in, site_out, transmission, commodity in m.tra_tuples:
			# exports increase balance
			if site_in == sit and commodity == com:
				balance += m.e_tra_in[(tm, site_in, site_out, transmission, com)]
			# imports decrease balance
			if site_out == sit and commodity == com:
				balance -= m.e_tra_out[(tm, site_in, site_out, transmission, com)]
		for site, storage, commodity in m.sto_tuples:
			# usage as input for storage increases consumption
			# output from storage decreases consumption
			if site == sit and commodity == com:
				balance += m.e_sto_in[(tm, site, storage, com)]
				balance -= m.e_sto_out[(tm, site, storage, com)]
		return balance

Constraints
===========

Commodity Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Vertex Rule**: Vertex rule is the main constraint that has to be satisfied for every commodity. This constraint is defined differently for each commodity type. The inequality requires, that any imbalance (CB>0, CB<0) of a commodity :math:`c` in a site :math:`v` at a timestep :math:`t` to be balanced by a corresponding source term or demand.

* Environmental commodities :math:`C_\text{env}`: this constraint is not defined for environmental commodities.
* Suppy intermittent commodities :math:`C_\text{sup}`: this constraint is not defined for supply intermittent commodities.
* Stock commodities :math:`C_\text{st}`: For stock commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must be supplied by the stock commodity purchases. In other words, commodity balance :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` subtracted from the variable stock commodity source term :math:`\rho_{vct}` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{st}, t\in T_m\colon \qquad & \qquad - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) + \rho_{vct} &\geq 0


* Sell commodities :math:`C_\text{sell}`: For sell commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must be supplied by the sell commodity trades. In other words, commodity balance :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` subtracted from minus the variable sell commodity source term :math:`\varrho_{vct}` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{sell}, t\in T_m\colon \qquad & \qquad  - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) - \varrho_{vct} &\geq 0

* Buy commodities :math:`C_\text{buy}`: For buy commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must be supplied by the buy commodity purchases. In other words, commodity balance :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` subtracted from the variable buy commodity source term :math:`\psi_{vct}` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{buy}, t\in T_m\colon \qquad & \qquad  - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) + \psi_{vct} &\geq 0

* Demand commodities :math:`C_\text{dem}`: For demand commodities, the possible imbalance of the commodity must supply the demand :math:`d_{vct}` of demand commodities :math:`c \C_\text{dem}`. In other words, the parameter demand for commodity subtracted :math:`d_{vct}` from the minus commodity balance :math:`-\mathrm{CB}(v,c,t)` must be greater than or equal to 0 to satisfy this constraint. In mathematical notation this is expressed as: 

.. math::
	\forall v\in V, c\in C_\text{dem}, t\in T_m\colon \qquad & \qquad  - \mathrm{CB}(v,c,t) - d_{vct} &\geq 0

		#                       amount of the commodity com
		power_surplus = - commodity_balance(m, tm, sit, com)
	
		# if com is a stock commodity, the commodity source term e_co_stock
		# can supply a possibly negative power_surplus
		if com in m.com_stock:

		# can supply a possibly negative power_surplus
		if com in m.com_buy:
			power_surplus += m.e_co_buy[tm, sit, com, com_type]
	
		# if com is a demand commodity, the power_surplus is reduced by the
		# demand value; no scaling by m.dt or m.weight is needed here, as this
		# constraint is about power (MW), not energy (MWh)
		if com in m.com_demand:
			try:

To satisfy this constraint, the value of the variable stock commodity source term :math:`\rho_{vct}` must be less than or equal to the value of the parameter maximum stock supply limit per time step :math:`\overline{l}_{vc}`.

The limited amount is defined by the parameter maximum annual stock supply limit per vertex :math:`\overline{L}_{vc}`. To satisfy this constraint, the annual usage of stock commodity must be less than or equal to the value of the parameter stock supply limit per vertex :math:`\overline{L}_{vc}`. The annual usage of stock commodity is calculated by the sum of the products of the parameter weight :math:`w`, the parameter timestep duration :math:`\Delta t` and the parameter stock commodity source term :math:`\rho_{vct}` for every timestep :math:`t \in T_m`. In mathematical notation this is expressed as:

Environmental Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Global CO2 Limit Rule**: The constraint global CO2 limit rule applies to the whole energy system, that is to say it applies to every site and timestep in general. This constraints restricts the energy model from releasing more environmental commodities, namely CO2 to environment than allowed. The constraint states that the sum of released environmental commodities for every site :math:`v` and every timestep :math:`t` must be less than or equal to the parameter maximum global annual CO2 emission limit :math:`\overline{L}_{CO_{2}}`, where the amount of released enviromental commodites in a single site :math:`v` at a single timestep :math:`t` is calculated by the product of commodity balance of enviromental commodities :math:`\mathrm{CB}(v,CO_{2},t)` and the parameter weight :math:`w`. This constraint is skipped if the value of the parameter :math:`\overline{L}_{CO_{2}}` is set to ``inf``. In mathematical notation this constraint is expressed as:

.. math::

	w \sum_{t\in T_\text{m}} \sum_{v \in V} \mathrm{CB}(v,CO_{2},t) \leq \overline{L}_{CO_{2}}

In script ``urbs.py`` the constraint global CO2 limit rule is defined and calculated by the following code fragment:
